Building and Running
====================

1.)  Make sure the data directory has the input and output files.
2.)  Load CUDA 8.0 to compile for P100.  Code does work with CUDA 7.5 as well
     but will issue a compiler warning about atomicAdd (can be safely ignored).
     You need a C++11 compatible host compiler - any new gcc will do.
3.)  Type 'make'
4.)  Type 'make run' to run the original data set, or 'make run$' for $=1,2,3
     to run the SKA data sets


Environment Variables
